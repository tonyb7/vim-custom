## Vim Customization
===

## About
This is the Vim customization which I started. I have borrowed from the following repositories:

* [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim), a Vim package manager
* [One Dark theme](https://github.com/joshdick/onedark.vim), a theme for Vim based on Atom's One Dark theme
